After cloning/pulling this repo and having jekyll installed properly you should be
able to simply navigate to the directory in the command line that you have cloned 
it in and type "jekyll serve" this should host the local host at localhost:4000.

From here we can add to and take away from out main files which will be our index.html (homepage), any 
other .html files (localhost:4000/other.html) etc, write scripts and bind documents.
